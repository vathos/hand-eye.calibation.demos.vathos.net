# hand-eye.calibation.demos.vathos.net

Example of running hand-eye calibration with Vathos' cloud-edge-based computer vision API. For a detailed explanation of functionality and usage, please, refer to our online [user guide](https://docs.vathos.net/guides/handeye.html).

Note that the included sample data set is not sufficiently large to obtain calibrations accurate enough for production deployments.
